Abstracted OpenZeppelin smart contracts written in Rust for Arbitrum Stylus.

## Project description

open-stylus is a library of smart contracts written in Rust for Arbitrum Stylus. It aims to abstract some parts of the OpenZeppelin code and adapt it to Rust for Stylus. 

Arbitrum Stylus is a new technology that allows developers to write EVM-compatible smart contracts in many different programming languages, such as Rust, C, and C++, by using WebAssembly (WASM) as a second, coequal virtual machine. This enables faster, cheaper, and more efficient computation and memory usage on Arbitrum chains.

## Installation and usage

To use open-stylus, you need to have the following prerequisites installed:

- Rust: The programming language used to write the smart contracts. You can install it from [here](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-write-and-deploy-your-first-smart-contract-341d5e2ffb35/).
- Cargo: The Rust package manager and build tool. You can install it from [here](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-write-a-good-readme-file/).
- Stylus: The Arbitrum toolchain for compiling and deploying smart contracts. You can install it from [here](https://dev.to/github/how-to-create-the-perfect-readme-for-your-open-source-project-1k69).

To install open-stylus, you can clone this repository and run the following command in the root directory:

```bash
cargo install --path .

```

This will install the open-stylus library as a dependency in your project.

To use open-stylus, you can import the modules you need in your Rust code. For example, to use the ERC20 module, you can write:

Rust

```rust
use open_stylus::acess::Ownable;

```

Then, you can create and interact with ERC20 tokens using the methods provided by the module. For example, to create a new token with a name, symbol, and initial supply, you can write:

Rust
